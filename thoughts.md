Key Takeaways:

1. I really need to practice my Mac shortcuts. I am super ingrained in Windows hotkeys so it will take some time to get back up to speed, as well as learn Mac paradigms. Shortcuts will greatly increase productivity.

2. Creating and working with calendars is an art. Without good time management it will be very difficult to succeed.

New Strategies:

1. Carve out time for your personal health and wellness. If you don't know one will. It will benefit your work even if it takes you away from actively working on what you are working on.

2. Good note taking can increase what you retain in class, as well as making it better to revisit. Colors, drawings, highlighting and translating lectures into your own language can help learn.
